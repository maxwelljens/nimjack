## About the Project

This is my first fully fledged program written in any language. It was done as exercise, but it is, for all intents and
purposes, a minimally viable product, however basic. There's not particularly many features, but it works.

## Building

**Dependencies:** Nim, [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.nim)

```txt
nimble install docopt
nim c "/path/to/source/nimjack.nim"
```
